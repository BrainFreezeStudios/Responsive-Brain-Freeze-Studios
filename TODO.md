So far the menu items consist of images, i would rather have 'em as HTML+CSS elements, i added some CSS rules called "bokmarks" to try and acieve this, but results werent what i wanted, so css rule is still there, but wont be using it, till i figure a way to acieve what i want.



Fix CSS File
==================
A file named "New Style.css" has been created, there the new, clearner, and hopefully better, css should be created, later "style.css" will be deleted permanently.
