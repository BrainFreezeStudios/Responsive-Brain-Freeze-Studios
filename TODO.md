##Change data access code to PDO##
==================


- [x] Switch code, from msqli to PDO to make it more compatible with most free webhosting (specially 00webhosting), as well as make it more maintainable.


##Update Home design changes##
==================


- [X] Some design chages regarding the look and feel of the home page where taken, now its time to update them.


##Create/Find New jQuery image slide##
==================


- [X] Currently we are using a jQuery script called "Presentation Cycle" created by Gaya Kessler, im not even sure the license is this script using, so we may as well find another or create our own to prevent any future problems.

##Create the missing administration pages##
==================


There are some administration pages still missing, so its time to add them.


##Create CSS file for administrative pages##
==================


There is no design defined for administrative pages, so let's make 'em pretty :).


##Add documentation to pages##
==================


- [X] Some pages are missing documentation (yeah, got lazy at some point).


##Change Menu##
==================


- [X] So far the menu items consist of images, i would rather have 'em as HTML+CSS elements, i added some CSS rules called "bookmarks" to try and achieve this, but results weren't what i wanted, so css rule is still there, but wont be using it, till i figure a way to acieve what i want.



##Fix CSS File##
==================
- [X] A file named "New Style.css" has been created, there the new, clearner, and hopefully better, css should be created, later "style.css" will be deleted permanently.

- [X] Delete old style and leave only the new one.
